 * The idea here is to be a flexible as possible to allow for any kind of periodicity,
 * a few examples:
 *
 * - Every 2 days
 * - Every 3 weeks on a Monday
 * - Every 4 months on the 15th
 * - Every 5 years on the 3rd month
 *
 * We should be careful when using this periodicity to account for february and leap years. This class is merely
 * a representation of the periodicity and should be used in conjunction with a date to calculate whatever is needed.
