# Loom (Previously Lumbridge) - Android Financial App

Loom is a simple financial app built for Android using and learning Jetpack Compose. It was created as a passion project to help manage day-to-day tasks and is open-source just for the love of the game, but eventually grew to a more solid piece. If you're interested, feel free to use it, improve it, or fork it!

## 🎯 Project Purpose

As stated before, it started a playground for me to learn and experiment with **Jetpack Compose** and modern Android development. However, my SO and friends around me saw use in this so I decided to keep adding features to it that they found useful. Eventually, it grew to a sizeable app, enough to be shared with everyone. I stand that open-source is the way to go, and I probably made and will continue to make a bunch of mistakes and less optimal choices during this development but, as coding usual is, this is a best effort to provide both learning material if anyone finds it interesting enough and a way to find people willing to contribute if they so desire. It's entirely open to more contributions, feature requests, and improvements!

## ⚠️ Disclaimer 🇵🇹

**Please note:** The **Net Salary Calculator** and **Tax Calculations** in Loom are currently tailored to **Portugal's tax system**. As such, they may not be accurate or applicable to other countries. I made this so other countries calculations can be added with "relative ease", and quotes are mandatory here as it's nevery easy to introduce an entirely new tax system into an app. But if you feel that's the only thing missing to use the app, why not create it yourself? 😄
