# Lumbridge - Android Financial App

Lumbridge is a simple financial app built for Android using and learning Jetpack Compose. It was created as a passion project to help manage day-to-day tasks and is open-source just for the love of the game. If you're interested, feel free to use it, improve it, or fork it!

## 🎯 Project Purpose

Lumbridge is more than just a financial utility app — it's a playground for me to learn and experiment with **Jetpack Compose** and modern Android development. The app includes several financial tools that I personally find useful, but it's entirely open to contributions, feature requests, and improvements!

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

Lumbridge leverages a modern Android development stack to ensure scalability, maintainability, and a smooth user experience:

- **Jetpack Compose**: The entire UI is built with Jetpack Compose, eliminating the need for XML and enabling declarative UI development.

- **MVVM**: Implements the MVVM architectural pattern.
- **Retrofit**: Handles networking operations.
- **Room**: Provides a robust database solution for local data persistence.
- **DataStore**: Manages key-value pairs and typed objects for data storage, offering a modern alternative to SharedPreferences.
- **BuildSrc (Gradle)**: Utilizes buildSrc for managing Gradle dependencies and build logic, ensuring a clean and organized build configuration.
- **Others**: Amongst other less famous dependencies. Feel free to check build.gradle to know more.
